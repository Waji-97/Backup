# âœ” Backup Repository
> This is a backup repository for the `system_check.sh` running in my Linux server. The script checks the system and uploads the `backup.tar` file automatically.

ðŸ’¡ The `backup.tar` file contains all of the apache server data.

- We can easily access the backed up data by unzipping the `.tar` file,

```bash
tar -xvf backup.tar
```

ðŸ‘‰ I have also uploaded the `system_check.sh` script file in this repository for reference ðŸ˜‰
